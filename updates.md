--> a working flask http endpoint is ready. it is able to receive POST requests with emoji data. tested endpoint as well with curl it is working fine.
<br/>
<br/>
--> client side code created to simulate front-end. 
<br/>
<br/>
--> aggregation logic working smoothly to display each emoji's count with windowing every 2 seconds
<br/>
<br/>
--> pub sub architecture implemented and subscriber channels ready for clients to connect
<br/>
<br/>
--> front-end html page allowing user to pick a subscriber channel to subscribe to and then displaying emoji counts from the back-end
<br/>
<br/>
--> alternate spark_streaming_code uploaded to repo as well to showcase cummulative aggregation (as in the entire count of emoji from the start would be shown from beginning and get update real time. it is not required for the project but i thought it would be more complex and cool to do....so did it anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
--> left to work on now beyond this is making the front-end look cooler. But then again the main essence of the project and the architectures have been implemented so improving front-end design is just an option for now. if we have time as a team let's sit and finish that otherwise i think our work is aight.

<br/>
<br/>

--> **UPDATE**
<br/>
<br/>
--> the front-end has been styled and it looks good now. i think our project is done. ggs team.
